Continuation of a once started self project on learning Graphs from a pool of my private repos 


Thought hard about a rather non traditional way of representing graphs, which can be better managed and more scalable than other approaches I seen IMO.

That is, if you don't want to rely on an external libs, which you should do rely on them(well-tested and  more effort went in them)... But... it's just for practice so why not?


I kind of littered the project with basic problems, and will probably do so in the future...


Will pick up more algs and practice problems once I have a bit more fun with writing concurrent code



Why? Because, in the future, I hope to integrate Graphs into the backend for Augment for different reasons, one being connecting users
